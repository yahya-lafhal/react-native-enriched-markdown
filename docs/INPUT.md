# EnrichedMarkdownInput

`EnrichedMarkdownInput` is a rich text input component that outputs Markdown. It is an uncontrolled input — it doesn't use any state or props to store its value, but instead directly interacts with the underlying platform-specific components. Thanks to this, the component is really performant and simple to use.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of an input that lets you toggle bold on its text and shows whether bold is currently active via the button color.

```tsx
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  EnrichedMarkdownInput,
  type EnrichedMarkdownInputInstance,
  type StyleState,
} from 'react-native-enriched-markdown';

export default function App() {
  const ref = useRef<EnrichedMarkdownInputInstance>(null);
  const [state, setState] = useState<StyleState | null>(null);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <EnrichedMarkdownInput
        ref={ref}
        placeholder="Type here..."
        onChangeState={setState}
        style={styles.input}
      />
      <View style={styles.toolbar}>
        <Button
          title={state?.bold.isActive ? 'Unbold' : 'Bold'}
          color={state?.bold.isActive ? 'green' : 'gray'}
          onPress={() => ref.current?.toggleBold()}
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  input: { width: '100%', fontSize: 20, padding: 10, maxHeight: 200, backgroundColor: 'lightgray' },
  toolbar: { flexDirection: 'row', gap: 8, marginTop: 8 },
});
```

Summary of what happens here:

1. Any methods imperatively called on the input to e.g. toggle some style must be used through a `ref` of `EnrichedMarkdownInputInstance` type. Here, `toggleBold` method that is called on the button press calls `ref.current?.toggleBold()`, which toggles the bold styling within the current selection.
2. All style state information is emitted by the `onChangeState` callback. The callback payload provides a nested object for each style (e.g., `bold`, `italic`), containing an `isActive` property to guide your UI logic — indicating if the style is currently applied (highlight the button).

## Inline Styles

Supported styles:

- bold
- italic
- underline
- strikethrough

Each of the styles can be toggled the same way as in the example from [usage section](#usage); call a proper `toggle` function on the component ref.

Each call toggles the style within the current text selection. They are being toggled on exactly the character range that is currently selected. When toggling the style with just the cursor in place (no selection), the style is ready to be used and will be applied to the next characters that the user inputs.

Styles are also available through the built-in native format bar that appears on text selection, and through the system context menu.

## Lists

Supported lists:
- Ordered lists (numbered)
- Unordered lists (bullet points)

Each of the lists can be toggled the same way as the inline styles. A `toggle` function is provided for both list types. Toggling a list or having the cursor on a list sets the `isActive` property of the `StyleState` of the list type to `true`, otherwise it is set to `false`.

## Links

Links are a piece of text with a URL attributed to it. They can be managed by calling methods on the input ref:

- [`setLink(url)`](API_REFERENCE.md#setlinkurl-string) — applies a link to the currently selected text.
- [`insertLink(text, url)`](API_REFERENCE.md#insertlinktext-string-url-string) — inserts a new link at the cursor position with the given text and URL. Useful when there is no selection.
- [`removeLink()`](API_REFERENCE.md#removelink) — removes the link from the current selection.

The built-in native format bar also includes a link option that presents a URL prompt when text is selected.

A complete example of a setup that supports both setting links on the selected text, as well as inserting them at the cursor position can be found in the example app code.

## Auto-Link Detection

`EnrichedMarkdownInput` can automatically detect URLs as the user types and convert them into Markdown links. Detected links are visually styled in the input and serialized as `[text](url)` in the Markdown output.

### Basic usage

Auto-link detection is enabled by default. URLs like `google.com`, `www.google.com`, and `https://google.com` are detected when followed by a space or newline.

Bare domains and `www.` prefixes are automatically normalized with `https://` (e.g., `google.com` becomes `[google.com](https://google.com)`).

### Custom regex

You can provide a custom regex pattern to control which text is detected as a link:

```tsx
<EnrichedMarkdownInput
  linkRegex={/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/i}
/>
```

Pass `null` to disable auto-link detection entirely:

```tsx
<EnrichedMarkdownInput linkRegex={null} />
```

### Listening for detections

Use the `onLinkDetected` callback to be notified when a new link is detected:

```tsx
<EnrichedMarkdownInput
  onLinkDetected={({ text, url, start, end }) => {
    console.log(`Detected link: ${text} -> ${url} at [${start}, ${end}]`);
  }}
/>
```

The callback fires only for newly detected links — not for links that were already detected and remain unchanged.

### Interaction with manual links

When a manual link is applied (via `setLink` or `insertLink`) over an auto-detected link, the auto-detected link is replaced by the manual one. Auto-link detection skips ranges that already contain a manual link.

## Style Detection

All of the above styles can be detected with the use of [onChangeState](API_REFERENCE.md#onchangestate) callback payload.

You can find some examples in the [usage section](#usage) or in the example app.

## Other Events

`EnrichedMarkdownInput` emits a few more events that may be of use:

- [onFocus](API_REFERENCE.md#onfocus-1) - emits whenever input focuses.
- [onBlur](API_REFERENCE.md#onblur) - emits whenever input blurs.
- [onChangeText](API_REFERENCE.md#onchangetext) - returns the input's plain text (without Markdown syntax) anytime it changes.
- [onChangeMarkdown](API_REFERENCE.md#onchangemarkdown) - returns the Markdown string parsed from current input text and styles anytime it would change. As parsing the Markdown on each input change can be expensive, not assigning the event's callback will skip the serialization for better performance.
- [onChangeSelection](API_REFERENCE.md#onchangeselection) - returns `{ start, end }` of the current selection, useful for working with [links](#links).

## Customizing \<EnrichedMarkdownInput /> Styles

`EnrichedMarkdownInput` accepts a `markdownStyle` prop for customizing how formatted text appears in the input:

```tsx
<EnrichedMarkdownInput
  markdownStyle={{
    strong: { color: '#1D4ED8' },
    em: { color: '#7C3AED' },
    link: { color: '#2563EB', underline: true },
  }}
/>
```

Available style properties:

- `strong.color` — text color for bold text (defaults to the input's text color).
- `em.color` — text color for italic text (defaults to the input's text color).
- `link.color` — text color for links (defaults to `#2563EB`).
- `link.underline` — whether links are underlined (defaults to `true`).
